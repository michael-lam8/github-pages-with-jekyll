# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my job. At the time of writing this, I am working a shift. You can see the hard work and dedication that I put into this job. Normally, I would care, but they give me an iPad with no restrictions, and nobody comes to me. Why, you may be wondering. That's because I work as a Silent Auctioneer for the Sens Store. I'm sure you can figure out the rest...
